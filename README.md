# Beautiful gradient slider in React

This project was created as a replicate version of [UI-Range](https://github.com/yairEO/ui-range) by [yairEO](https://github.com/yairEO)

## Why?

I stumbled across his codepen the other day, frustrated that I didn't understand anything about his code.
So I decided to make one myself in React and implement my own way of logic in it.

## Demo

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/M1135/pen/Vwrrzdx)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M1135/React-Gradient-Slider.git
```
## Usage

After cloning, you can modify it as a component to fit your needs.

It is highly customizable such as adding prefix and suffix, change progress bar color, etc.

## Final words

I made this as a sophomore so it is not as perfect as one from a senior developer, any advices are welcomed :)
